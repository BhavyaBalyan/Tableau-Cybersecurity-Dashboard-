# Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015-2024) - Tableau Project

## Overview

This Tableau project analyzes global cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024, providing interactive visualizations to understand trends, attack types, affected industries, and geographical distributions. The goal is to offer insights into the evolving threat landscape and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Reported cyber incidents from 2015-2024
- Categories of cyber threats (e.g., malware, ransomware, phishing, data breaches)
- Affected industries (e.g., finance, healthcare, government, retail)
- Geographical distribution of cyber incidents
- Financial and operational impacts of cyberattacks

## Key Visualizations
